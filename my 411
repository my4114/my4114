A personal loan is a type of installment loan where borrowers receive a lump sum and then repay it in increments over a period of time. Personal loan amounts can range from a few hundred dollars to $1,000. The repayment terms may also vary: some can be paid off in a few months while others may be repaid over years.

Personal loans can be unsecured or secure. Secured loans require the borrower to provide collateral to back the loan while unsecured loans don’t. Since unsecured loans don’t require collateral, lenders typically determine the terms of your loan by evaluating your creditworthiness—–the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to receive favorable terms, including a lower APR.  Lenders may also look at your annual income, credit history, and debt-to-income (my 411) ratio.
